# Animal-kingdom-classification

The keyword "exends" shows INHERITANCE and it can be seen all over the work clearly.

The base class is the animal class and it is an ABSTRACTION class that cannot be instantiated.
if you try to instantiate it, it will throw an error.

it has methods that all the sub-classes can inherit.
Allsub-classes have access to the methods move() and eat()
every sub-class that extends from animal has the properties of name and skeleton type.

The vertebrate class has an ENCAPSULATED method called molt. molt returns 'i am going to shed my skin' if the prototype of the object is an inverterbrate. otherwise, it won't run.

withbackbone() is a method that returns a boolean(true) for vertebrates and false for inverterbrates!

skeletontype() property is POLYMORPHIC. it shows different values in the different subclasses inheriting
from the base class 'animal'
Reproduce()method is also POLYMORPHIC. it returns different values for different subclassews
